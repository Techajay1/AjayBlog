                <h3>What exactly is HTML?</h3>
                <p>
                    The most common language used to create websites is HTML.
                    HTML is a markup language that is used to generate and maintain web pages.

                <h3>What is the History of HTML?</h3>
                <p>
                    Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others designed HTML for the first time in 1989. 
                    Hyper Text Markup Language is the abbreviation for Hyper Text Markup Language.
                    <br><br>
                    The term "hypertext" refers to a document that has links that allow the reader to 
                    navigate to different parts of the page or to another document entirely. 
                    HTML5 is the most recent version.
                    <br><br>
                    A Markup Language is a way for computers to communicate with one another in order to 
                    show how text is processed and displayed on the computerâ€™s browser. 
                    Tags and attributes are used in HTML to do this.

                </p>

                <h3>What Are HTML Tags and How Do I Use Them?</h3>
                <p>
                    Tags are used to indicate the beginning of an HTML element and are often enclosed in angle brackets. For example <br>
                     &lt;h1&gt;is an example of a tag.
                <br>
                    To operate, most tags must be opened &lt;h1&gt; and closed &lt;h1/&gt;.
                </p>
               
                <h3>What are HTML Attributes and How Do I Use Them?</h3>
                <p>
                    Attributes are data fields that include additional information. 
                    Attributes are represented by an opening tag with extra information inside. <br><br>
                    An attribute might be something like: <br><br>
                    &lt;img src="mydog.jpg" alt="A photo of my dog." width="200" height="200"&gt; <br><br>

                    The image source (src) ,(alt), and width,height are attributes of the img> tag in this case.
